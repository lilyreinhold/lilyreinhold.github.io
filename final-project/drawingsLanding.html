					<p><h2>Larry the Trapeze Rat</h2>
					Larry was one of the first rats documented. He was seen near Lincoln Square. He likes to hop and jump around on the tracks. The best trick he has is jumping from off the middle rail and dissapearing between tracks. Weight from his thick pink tail provides balance for aerial maneuvers.

					<p><h2>McRat</h2>
					McRat was found in a discarded McDonalds french fry container on the tracks of a subway. McRat tried to camouflage, as he was literally inside the whole container and only his tail was sticking out like another french fry. He wanted to find a fry; he succeeded at getting his nose covered in french fry salt and pulled out a fry the size of his face.<p>

					<p><h2>Abstract Rat</h2>
					Abstract rat is abstracted both metaphorically and visually. Inspiration for this rat comes from a plastic bag rat illusion. Said rat was only somewhat seen in a plastic bag - an outline of his bony body was visible to human eyes. This rat provokes the question if a rat was "really there" if it was not seen for sure. <p>
